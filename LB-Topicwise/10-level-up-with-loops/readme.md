# Assignment-10: Level Up with Loops

This assignment takes your loop skills to the next level with more advanced logical problems, including Fibonacci series, prime numbers, co-primes, HCF, and Armstrong numbers. These problems will challenge your understanding of number theory and loop optimization in C++.

## Questions

1. Write a program to find the **Nth term of the Fibonacci series**.
2. Write a program to print the **first N terms of the Fibonacci series**.
3. Write a program to check whether a given number is **present in the Fibonacci series** or not.
4. Write a program to **calculate the HCF of two numbers**.
5. Write a program to check whether **two given numbers are co-prime** or not.
6. Write a program to **print all prime numbers under 100**.
7. Write a program to **print all prime numbers between two given numbers**.
8. Write a program to **find the next prime number** of a given number.
9. Write a program to check whether a given number is an **Armstrong number** or not.
10. Write a program to **print all Armstrong numbers under 1000**.
