# Assignment-5: Decision Control Statements

This section includes questions that focus on decision-making constructs in programming such as `if`, `else`, and `else if` statements. These exercises aim to build your logical thinking and strengthen your understanding of control flow in C++.

## Questions

1. Write a program to check whether a given number is **positive or non-positive**.
2. Write a program to check whether a given number is **divisible by 5 or not**.
3. Write a program to check whether a given number is an **even number or an odd number**.
4. **Write a program to check whether a given number is an even number or an odd number without using the `%` operator.**
5. **Write a program to check whether the given number is even or odd using a bitwise operator.**
6. Write a program to check whether a given number is a **three-digit number or not**.
7. Write a program to **print the greater between two numbers**. Print one number if both are the same.
8. Write a program to check whether **roots of a given quadratic equation** are real & distinct, real & equal, or imaginary.
9. Write a program to check whether a given year is a **leap year or not**.
10. Write a program to find the **greatest among three given numbers**. Print the number once if the greatest number appears two or three times.
