# Operators

This section covers various types of operators in programming, focusing on arithmetic, assignment, comparison, logical, and ternary operators. Through hands-on activities and tasks, learners will practice using these operators in simple programs, laying a foundation for more complex logic-building in code.

## Activities and Tasks

### Activity 1: Arithmetic Operations
Perform basic arithmetic operations on numbers and log results to the console.

- **Task 1:** Write a program to add two numbers and log the result to the console.
- **Task 2:** Write a program to subtract two numbers and log the result to the console.
- **Task 3:** Write a program to multiply two numbers and log the result to the console.
- **Task 4:** Write a program to divide two numbers and log the result to the console.
- **Task 5:** Write a program to find the remainder when one number is divided by another and log the result to the console.

### Activity 2: Assignment Operators
Use assignment operators to modify and update variable values.

- **Task 6:** Use the `+=` operator to add a number to a variable and log the result to the console.
- **Task 7:** Use the `-=` operator to subtract a number from a variable and log the result to the console.

### Activity 3: Comparison Operators
Compare two numbers and log the results using different comparison operators.

- **Task 8:** Write a program to compare two numbers using `>` and `<` and log the result to the console.
- **Task 9:** Write a program to compare two numbers using `>=` and `<=` and log the result to the console.
- **Task 10:** Write a program to compare two numbers using `==` and `===` and log the result to the console.

### Activity 4: Logical Operators
Combine conditions and evaluate expressions using logical operators.

- **Task 11:** Write a program that uses the `&&` operator to combine two conditions and log the result to the console.
- **Task 12:** Write a program that uses the `||` operator to combine two conditions and log the result to the console.
- **Task 13:** Write a program that uses the `!` operator to negate a condition and log the result to the console.

### Activity 5: Ternary Operator
Use the ternary operator for conditional expressions.

- **Task 14:** Write a program that uses the ternary operator to check if a number is positive or negative and log the result to the console.

## Feature Requests

- **1. Arithmetic Operations Script:** Develop a script that performs all basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and remainder) on two numbers and logs each result.
  
- **2. Comparison and Logical Operators Script:** Create a script that compares two numbers with different comparison operators and combines conditions using logical operators, logging each result.

- **3. Ternary Operator Script:** Write a script that uses the ternary operator to determine if a number is positive or negative and logs the result.
