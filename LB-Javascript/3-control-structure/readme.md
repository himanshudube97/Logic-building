# Control Structures

This module focuses on various control structures in programming, including `if-else` statements, nested `if-else`, `switch` cases, conditional (ternary) operators, and combining multiple conditions. Each activity is designed to strengthen your understanding of control flow and decision-making in programming.

## Tasks and Activities

### Activity 1: If-Else Statements
- **Task 1:** Write a program to check if a number is positive, negative, or zero. Log the result to the console.
- **Task 2:** Write a program to check if a person is eligible to vote (age >= 18). Log the result to the console.

### Activity 2: Nested If-Else Statements
- **Task 3:** Write a program to find the largest of three numbers using nested `if-else` statements.

### Activity 3: Switch Case
- **Task 4:** Write a program that uses a `switch` case to determine the day of the week based on a number (1-7). Log the day name to the console.
- **Task 5:** Write a program that uses a `switch` case to assign a grade (`A`, `B`, `C`, `D`, `F`) based on a score. Log the grade to the console.

### Activity 4: Conditional (Ternary) Operator
- **Task 6:** Write a program that uses the ternary operator to check if a number is even or odd. Log the result to the console.

### Activity 5: Combining Conditions
- **Task 7:** Write a program to check if a year is a leap year using multiple conditions (divisible by 4, but not 100 unless also divisible by 400). Log the result to the console.

## Feature Requests

1. **Number Check Script:** Write a script that checks if a number is positive, negative, or zero using `if-else` statements. Log the result.
2. **Voting Eligibility Script:** Create a script to check if a person is eligible to vote based on their age and log the result.
3. **Day of the Week Script:** Write a script that uses a `switch` case to determine the day of the week based on a number (1-7) and log the day name.
4. **Grade Assignment Script:** Create a script that uses a `switch` case to assign a grade based on a score and log the grade.
5. **Leap Year Check Script:** Write a script that checks if a year is a leap year using multiple conditions and log the result.

## üèÜ Achievement

By the end of these activities, you will:
- Understand and implement basic `if-else` control flow.
- Use nested `if-else` statements to handle multiple conditions.
- Utilize `switch` cases for control flow based on specific values.
- Apply the ternary operator for concise condition checking.
- Combine multiple conditions to solve complex problems.


- Happy Coding !
