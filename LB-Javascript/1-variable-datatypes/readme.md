# Variables and Data Types

This topic covers essential concepts of variable declaration, different data types, and understanding reassignment in JavaScript. Completing these activities will give you a solid foundation in variable handling and type management.

## 📚 Tasks / Activities

### Activity 1: Variable Declaration
1. **Task 1**: Declare a variable using `var`, assign it a number, and log the value to the console.
2. **Task 2**: Declare a variable using `let`, assign it a string, and log the value to the console.

### Activity 2: Constant Declaration
3. **Task 3**: Declare a variable using `const`, assign it a boolean value, and log the value to the console.

### Activity 3: Data Types
4. **Task 4**: Create variables of different data types (`number`, `string`, `boolean`, `object`, `array`) and log each variable's type using the `typeof` operator.

### Activity 4: Reassigning Variables
5. **Task 5**: Declare a variable using `let`, assign it an initial value, reassign a new value, and log both values to the console.

### Activity 5: Understanding `const`
6. **Task 6**: Try reassigning a variable declared with `const` and observe the error.

## 🔍 Feature Requests

1. **Variable Types Console Log**: Write a script that declares variables of different data types and logs both the value and type of each variable to the console.
2. **Reassignment Demo**: Create a script that demonstrates the difference in behavior between `let` and `const` when it comes to reassignment.

## 🏆 Achievement

By completing these activities, you will:
- Know how to declare variables using `var`, `let`, and `const`.
- Understand the different data types in JavaScript.
- Be able to use the `typeof` operator to identify the data type of a variable.
- Understand the concept of variable reassignment and the immutability of `const` variables.
