## Activities and Tasks

### Activity 1: Function Declaration
1. **Task 1**: Write a function to check if a number is even or odd and log the result to the console.
2. **Task 2**: Write a function to calculate the square of a number and return the result.

### Activity 2: Function Expression
3. **Task 3**: Write a function expression to find the maximum of two numbers and log the result to the console.
4. **Task 4**: Write a function expression to concatenate two strings and return the result.

### Activity 3: Arrow Functions
5. **Task 5**: Write an arrow function to calculate the sum of two numbers and return the result.
6. **Task 6**: Write an arrow function to check if a string contains a specific character and return a boolean value.

### Activity 4: Function Parameters and Default Values
7. **Task 7**: Write a function that takes two parameters and returns their product. Provide a default value for the second parameter.
8. **Task 8**: Write a function that takes a person's name and age and returns a greeting message. Provide a default value for the age.

### Activity 5: Higher-Order Functions
9. **Task 9**: Write a higher-order function that takes a function and a number, and calls the function that many times.
10. **Task 10**: Write a higher-order function that takes two functions and a value, applies the first function to the value, and then applies the second function to the result.
